Queen Vrisha Bhanu of Tikamgarh built the temple in 1910 AD.In 1657, a golden statue of the Goddess Sita was found at the very spot, and Sita is said to have lived there. The legend said it that it was built on the holy site where Sannyasi Shurkishordas had found the images of Goddess Sita. In fact, Shurkishordas was the founder of modern Janakpur and the great saint and poet who preached about the Sita Upasana (also called Sita Upanishad) philosophy. Legend has claimed it that King Janak(Seeradhwaj) performed the worship of Shiva-Dhanus on this site.</p>

This you can observe when you witness the temple. The story goes like this; when king installed Mother Goddess' idol here in temple, he also buiilt a Ganesha Temple and Shiva Temple in the same complex. So as Ganesha is always worshipped ahead of all deities, so it happened that whoever visited the temple, started visiting Ganesha first, then Shiva and in the end, the devotee would reach Mother Kaali. So it is said Mother Kaali's idol turned its back to all other temples and now the Temple's front entrance is there where Motehr Kaalo's idol is installed and you get to visit Ganesha at the very end. I think it is one and only temple in the world where two deities have their back towards each otehr.</p>

The state was established in 1778 by Jogis clan, who were granted land by the ruler of the nearby state of Orchha.(Maihar king developed the other state Vijayraghavgarh). The state became a princely state of British India in the early 19th century, and was administered as part of Bundelkhand Agency in the Central India Agency. In 1871 the eastern states of Bundelkhand Agency, including Maihar, were separated to form the new agency of Bagelkhand in Central India. In 1933 Maihar, along with ten other states in western Bagelkhand, were transferred back to the Bundelkhand Agency. The title of the ruler is "Maharaja" and the present ruler is HH Maharaja Shrimant Saheb Akshay Raj Singh Ju deo Bahadur. The state had an area of 407 square miles (1,050 km2), and a population of 63,702 in 1901. The state, which was watered by the Tamsa River, consists mainly of alluvial soil covering sandstone, and is fertile except in the hilly district of the south. A large area was under forest, the produce of which provided a small export trade.</p>

You can access it either via a boat ride or the Mamleshwar Setu. Ideally, take a boat ride one way and walk the other. A series of steps from the ghats lead to the temple. You will pass through canopies of flower sellers to reach the base of the temple.The mandapa of the temple is beautifully made of 60 solid stone pillar carved with Yakshi figures. Around the temple walls, you will find images of various Devi Devatas.A unique thing about the Omkareshwar Jyotirlinga temple is that the main Shivalinga is not below the Shikara, it is on the side. I guess the temple may have been built later, and incline of the hill may not have allowed Shikhara over the Shivalinga. I could not gather any other reason for this. If you know, please do let me know.</p>

Slowly, the liquor level starts going down and you can see this miracle happening right in front of your eyes.</p>

According to beliefs, he said that he would not move from one temple to another and would always remain in the place where she would initially house the idol. Thus, the palace was later turned into a temple of the lord.</p>

	<h3 style="font-family: 'Noto Serif', serif;"> Chausath Yogini Temple</h3>
	<img src="img/mo2.jpg" height="450px;" width="100%" class="b">
	<br><p style="text-align: justify;">Mitawali Temple or Chausath Yogini Temple in Morena is located on a hill top and one of the rarest of rare Hindu temples in India. Its plan is circular type temple and it is dedicated to the Tantric sect of Chausath or 64 Yogini. Most of the Hindu temples structure are based on square or rectangular but circular temples like this are very rare in India. It is said that the design of Indian Parliament is inspired by this temple in Morena. It is also a very rare temple as there are 3 - 5 such temples around in India, Such as 2 in Orissa - Hirapur and Ranipur-Jharial, 3 in MP - Bhedaghat (Jabalpur), Khajuraoh and Mitawali. All are circular except the one in Khajurao.<br>

A Yogini in Tantra means a practitioner of Yoga, who has controlled her desires and reached a higher stage. They are related to the Matrikas and are basically various manifestations of the Divine Durga. This association with various forms of Sakti or pwoer give rise to the cult of Chausath or 64 Yoginis over time. The Chausath Yogini temple, Mitawali has an outer circle of 64 subsidiary shrines of Lord Shiva with a entral shrine of the Yogini. According to an inscription, it was built by King Devapala of the Pala dynasty of Bengal in 9th century.<br>

Chausath Yogini Temple, Mitawali is lies about 15 kms from Morena and about 55 kms from Gwalior and needs a whole day to cover all 6 spots. The Temples and monuments are well maintained by archeological survey of India (ASI). The ASI attendants are available everywhere and will assist the visitors about the history of these monuments free of cost. No commercial activity available in nearby.</p>

	<h3 style="font-family: 'Noto Serif', serif;">National Chambal Sanctuary </h3>
	<img src="img/mo3.jpg" height="450px;" width="100%" class="b">
	<br><p style="text-align: justify;">Located not very far away from heart of Morena city is this wildlife sanctuary, which is completely dedicated to aquatic animals. This probably is the only aquatic wildlife sanctuary in all of Madhya Pradesh state, which makes this place so much worth visiting. The main stay or feature of this sanctuary is Chambal River, where all aquatic animals reside. In this river though only crocodiles, dolphins and turtles reside. But mind you these crocodiles and dolphins belong to very rare species and it is only in this sanctuary that you’ll get the chance to witness them. To tell you more about these rare species, then they are known as Gharial Crocodile and Ganges River Dolphin. And we can tell you for sure that they look absolutely exotic and witnessing such animals with naked eyes is nothing less than a lifetime opportunity. Besides, you’ll also get to witness many beautiful migratory birds here. Over all, tour to this sanctuary is like having memorable encounter with Mother Nature. And this is something that we all crave for.</p>

	<h3 style="font-family: 'Noto Serif', serif;">Shanichara Temple </h3>
	<img src="img/mo4.jpg" height="450px;" width="100%" class="b">
	<br><p style="text-align: justify;">This is another very renowned temple of Morena . It is dedicated to Hindu god of Lord Shani, who is believed to have power to dispel all the misfortunes from our life. While there are many Shani temples in India, but this one is bit more unique than the rest. And this is all because of main deity, which actually is impersonation of human being and not any form of god. Besides, main deity is also strangely small, which in fact makes it look very pleasing to eyes. All said and done, this is another sacred temple that you should not be missing. And if you do have any plan to visit this temple, then we highly recommend to visit it on Saturday, as visiting Shani Temple on Saturday is considered very auspicious.</p>
